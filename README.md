# SAT Solver Assignment — Pets Puzzle + Sudoku via JS SAT

This repository contains two SAT-based solvers written in JavaScript:

1. `pets.js` — solves the 4-children / 4-pets logic puzzle  
2. `sudoku.js` — generates SAT clauses for Sudoku and solves it using a JS SAT solver  
   - `node src/sudoku.js` → solve one Sudoku  
   - `node src/sudoku.js --count` → enumerate all solutions (Knuth-style)

Requires Node.js and npm.
